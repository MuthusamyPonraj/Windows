		<b>March 10, 2006:</b><p>It's official: Solar minimum has arrived. Sunspots have 
			all but vanished. Solar flares are nonexistent. The sun is utterly quiet.</p>
		<p>Like the quiet before a storm.</p>
		<p />
		This week researchers announced that a storm is coming--the most intense solar 
		maximum in fifty years. <a href="#refer">The prediction</a> comes from a team 
		led by Mausumi Dikpati of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). 
		"The next sunspot cycle will be 30% to 50% stronger than the previous one," she 
		says. If correct, the years ahead could produce a burst of solar activity 
		second only to the historic Solar Max of 1958.</p>
		<p>That was a solar maximum. The Space Age was just beginning: Sputnik was launched 
			in Oct. 1957 and Explorer 1 (the first US satellite) in Jan. 1958. In 1958 you 
			couldn't tell that a solar storm was underway by looking at the bars on your 
			cell phone; cell phones didn't exist. Even so, people knew something big was 
			happening when Northern Lights were sighted three times in Mexico. A similar 
			maximum now would be noticed by its effect on cell phones, GPS, weather 
			satellites and many other modern technologies.</p>

		<p><a id="refer">Dikpati's prediction is unprecedented. In nearly-two centuries since 
				the 11-year sunspot cycle was discovered, scientists have struggled to predict 
				the size of future maxima—and failed. Solar maxima can be intense, as in 1958, 
				or barely detectable, as in 1805, obeying no obvious pattern.</a></p>
		<p>The key to the mystery, Dikpati realized years ago, is a conveyor belt on the 
			sun.</p>

		<p>We have something similar here on Earth—the Great Ocean Conveyor Belt, 
			popularized in the sci-fi movie The Day After Tomorrow. It is a network of 
			currents that carry water and heat from ocean to ocean--see the diagram below. 
			In the movie, the Conveyor Belt stopped and threw the world's weather into 
			chaos.</p>
