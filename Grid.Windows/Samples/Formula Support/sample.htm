<H1>Formula Support</H1>
<P>Essential Grid supports Excel-like formulas on each cell. It
also supports cross-sheet references and named ranges. You can easily
add custom functions to its function library. Setting the cell type of
a cell to a formula cell will allow you to enter algebraic expressions
and cell references. Cell references are entries such
as A11 for column A row 11 or BA3 for column BA row 3. A formula is a
defined calculation from the Formula Library, which is included with
Essential Grid. This Formula Library is extensible and allows you to
add additional formulas. 
</P>
<P>The different
samples that illustrate the Formula Support features of
Essential Grid are listed below:</P>
<P><B>Formula Grid Demo- </B>Implements a grid control that can have algebraic 
    formulas in its cells and displays all the functions in the GridFormulaEngine 
function library.</P>
<P><B>Formula Range Selection Demo- </B>Defines a class
called
<STRONG>FormulaRangeSelectionController,</STRONG> which allows you to
apply formulas to selected range of cells.</P>
<P><B>Cross-Reference Demo- </B>Illustrates making cross-sheet references
between grids.</P>
<P><B>Named Range Demo- </B>Illustrates the use of
multiple sheet references and named ranges with the GridFormulaEngine.</P>
<P><B>Retirement Simulation Demo- </B>Illustrates a way to use
<STRONG>GridFormulaEngine.NamedRanges</STRONG> in a grid control.</P>
