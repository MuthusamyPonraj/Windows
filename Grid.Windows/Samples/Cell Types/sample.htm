<H1>Cell Types</H1>
<P>Essential Grid uses a control-sharing architecture. While a combo box may appear in many different
cells (even with different drop-list content), there is usually only
a single combo box that is moved around and populated as needed.
This architecture allows Essential Grid to have many 
different controls without the overhead of creating multiple controls
of the same type. You can even create your own custom control types. Other
samples like, Derived Cell Control Tutorial, Cell Buttons and
Virtual Tree Grid have examples of derived cell controls.</P>
<p>Here is a list of the different samples under this category:</p>
<p><b>Editor Cell Demo</b> - This sample shows you how to place different editor controls into the cells.</p>
<p><b>Drop Down Cell Demo</b> - This sample illustrates the use of <b>ComboBox</b> and drop-down, <b>MulticolumnGridList</b> controls in grid cells.</p>
<p><b>Content Cell Demo</b> - This sample shows you how to use different controls in 
    the cells.</p>
<p><b>Interactive Cell Demo</b> - This sample illustrates the use of <b>RadioButton, 
    CheckBoxes, PushButton</b> controls in grid cells.</p>
<p><b>Web Browser Cell Demo</b> - This sample illustrates the hosting of a Web 
    browser in a grid cell.</p>
<p><b>Event Logger Demo</b> - This sample illustrates the order of current cell 
    events that are raised and the values that are present in a cell as the events 
    occur.</p>
