<H1>Virtual Grid</H1>
<P >A
virtual grid is a grid does not hold any data. All the
data that are displayed by the grid is provided on demand from some
external data source and sent to the grid when needed. Virtual grids are
ideal for displaying large amounts of data. This data is not moved from its original location or
stored in <strong>GridStyleInfo</strong> objects. Instead, <strong>GridStyleInfo</strong> objects are
created on the fly to temporarily hold only the necessary data and
are discarded when they are no longer needed. Hence, no data is stored
in the grid.</P>
<P >Implementing
a virtual grid is straightforward. Depending upon the functionality
that you need, you can implement a virtual grid with as few as three
events. To implement a virtual grid, you must tell the grid how many
rows and columns your data source has and provide the grid with the data
from your data source. You need to do these things in real time, only
when the grid requests these data elements. When the grid needs to
know the number of rows in it, it will fire the event <strong>QueryRowCount</strong>. When it needs to know the number of columns in the
grid, it will fire the <strong>QueryColCount</strong> event. When it needs to know a
<strong>GridStyleInfo</strong> object for a particular cell, it will fire the
<strong>QueryCellInfo</strong> event. By handling these events and setting appropriate
members of the <strong>EventArgs</strong>, you can provide the information that the
grid needs at the time it needs it.
