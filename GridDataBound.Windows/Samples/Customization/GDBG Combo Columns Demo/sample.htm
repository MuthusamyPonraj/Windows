<P>This demo illustrates Essential Grid&rsquo;s support for the
foreign-key combo boxes in grid cells. 
</P>
<P>In this sample, 
<UL>
	<LI><P>The top-left grid has three columns, which are
populated with three ID columns from the Orders table in the
Northwind database.</P>
	<LI><P>The first column shows the raw ID of the order,
but instead of the next two columns showing the customer ID and the
employee ID.</P>
	<LI><P>These columns use individual combo boxes to display the
company's name and the employee's name based on the IDs.</P>
	<LI><P>The combo boxes are bound to the <EM>Customer table</EM> and the <EM>Employee table</EM> in order
to make a correspondence between the IDs and the displayed values.</P>
	<LI><P>This sample shows these secondary tables(<EM>Customer table</EM> and <EM>Employee table</EM>) as well as a grid that
shows the raw values from the Orders table.</P>

	<LI><P>The entire sample is built
	using the designer, including the creation of data adapters for required
	tables and adding data bound grid columns to the primary grid that
	shows the foreign-key data.</P>
	<LI><P>The cell
	type of the grid is set to combo box to get the combo box
	columns; data source, display member, and value member are
	also set.</SPAN></P>
