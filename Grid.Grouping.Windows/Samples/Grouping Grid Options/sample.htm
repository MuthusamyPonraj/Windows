<h1>Grouping Grid Options</h1>

<p>The Grid Grouping Control has several options that can be used to customize the Grid Grouping Control.</p>
<p>
The different samples included in this feature are listed below:</p>

<p><p><b>Table Options Demo -</b> This sample illustrates properties of the <strong>GridTableOptionsStyleInfo</strong> class. The properties that are set through the 
table options are table-wide. </p>

<p><p><b>Top-Level Group Options Demo -</b> This sample illustrates properties of the
<strong>GridGroupOptionsStyleInfo</strong> class. The properties that are set through the 
top-level group options apply only to the top table and not to the nested child tables or to the child groups table. </p>

<p><p><b>Child-Group Options Demo -</b> This sample illustrates properties of the
<strong>GridGroupOptionsStyleInfo</strong> class. The properties that are set through the 
child-group options are applicable only for the child groups and not for the nested child table or detail tables.</p>

<p><p><b>Nested-Table Group Options Demo -</b> This sample illustrates some of the properties of the
<strong>GridGroupOptionsStyleInfo</strong> class. The properties that are set through the 
nested-table group options apply only to the related child tables in a 
hierarchy. </p>
