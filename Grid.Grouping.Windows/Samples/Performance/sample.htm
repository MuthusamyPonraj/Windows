<h1>Performance</h1>

<p>The performance of the Grid Grouping Control has been enhanced load high-frequency updates and optimize 
grid refreshing.</p>

<p>The different samples included in this feature are listed below:</p>

<p><p><b>Engine Optimization Demo - </b>This sample demonstrates the virtual-mode and 
without-counter-mode optimizations.</p>

<p><p><b>Grouping Performance Demo - </b>This sample will let you fill a grid 
grouping control with a specified number of records.&nbsp; You can also toggle various options 
to affect the speed of the grid.</p>

<p><p><b>Grouping Trader Grid Test Demo - </b>This sample demonstrates the frequent 
updates that occur in random cells across the Grid Grouping Control while 
keeping CPU usage to a minimum. A timer changes cells in short intervals, 
and it inserts and removes rows.</p>

<p><p><b>Market Simulation Demo - </b>This sample demonstrates how you can do faster 
data updates on Grid Grouping Controls while keeping CPU usage to a minimum.</p>

<p><b>Manual Total Summary Demo - </b>This sample features an implementation of very simple summaries that can be updated by 
applying a <em>delta</em> between old and new values whenever a record is changed; 
this allows for even faster updates for this specific kind of summary.</p>

<p><p><b>Real-time Update Demo - </b>This sample shows you how to optimize the refreshing of individual cells or summaries when an underlying data source is frequently changed.</p>
